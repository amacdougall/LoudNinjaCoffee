#Create view of article that has been selected from the list_articles
#Create the URL "loudninjacoffee/article/{whatever the article id is}"
#Create a call to the SQL, similar to the demo.py, that asks to SELECT title and text from article. And the requirement WHERE id={whatever the article's id is}
#Google shit, don't do more than what you need to just make it run correctly.
